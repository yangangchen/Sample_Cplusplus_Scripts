**Here are my sample C++ scripts.**

To run the code, you need to install the C++ library **Eigen**:
http://eigen.tuxfamily.org

Then execute:
```
$ make
$ ./myprogram
```

**Contents:**

1. Test script on Eclipse IDE.

2. Machine learning: Linear regression with the selection of regularization parameter lambda.

3. Machine learning: Generalized linear regression with the selection of regularization parameter lambda.

4. Machine learning: Gaussian process regression with the selection of kernel parameter sigma.

5. Machine learning: Combining the major nonliner regressors (generalized linear regression and Gaussian process regression) into a single class of inheritance.

Added features include inheritance, polymorphism in main.cpp (main, cross_validation), etc.

6. Machine learning: Combining the major nonliner regressors (generalized linear regression and Gaussian process regression) into a single class of inheritance.

Added features include the rule of five (copy constructor, copy assignment operator, move constructor, move assignment operator, destructor), dynamic memory allocation, etc.
